## Dictionaries
Dictionaries are provided as a convenience.
NNSVS/ENUNU doesn't support multi-syllable words, which limits the usefulness of these dictionaries.
For training you should ONLY use the blank.table file with a phonetic ust/score. The dictionary can be replaced after training.

Explaination of the dictionaries:

blank.table - Standard phonetic table. For _training_ and using voices phonetically rather than lexically.

Spanish:
* DVX_es-es_default_0.4.txt - Default Spanish dictionary, with full phoneme support
* DVX_es-es_simplified_0.4.txt - Simplified dicitonary for datasets created with non-native speakers.
* DVX_es-es_yeismo_0.4.txt  - Same as simplified dictionary, with [ll] replaced with [y] due to yeismo.
